The dataset utilized in this application is a static snapshot of the data as it existed at 02:57 AM on July 10, 2024, rather than a live feed from the API. This approach was necessitated by the limited quota of API requests available, and ensures that the application remains functional within these constraints. The use of a cached dataset enables the application to operate independently of real-time API calls, thereby optimizing performance and mitigating the risk of API throttling or exhaustion.
